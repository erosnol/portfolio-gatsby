import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

As an avid learner and thinker, the decision to learn to code came from my previous work experience. 

Programming is set to come an essential tool set to modern socitey within 20 years. 

The philosophy was built along my experiences in the auto industry, eCommerce, logistical & inventory implementations, Client Databases and seeing job scarcity through automation systems.

At 25 years old, I believe I am just getting started to contribute to build the future of tomorrow with Web 3.0, Metaverse & Quantum Computing.
